# hello-world
Startup guide ahaha

Writing in the readme because the guide told me so, la dee da dee doo.

I want to learn to program, as I've always found it interesting. I've tried several guides and websites over the years, like codeacademy.com and several e-books, but I've found it hard to commit to it.

This website seems like a really good idea though, so let's hope. :D
